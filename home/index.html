			<p>Fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish you call this cat food for sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor rub face on owner meow. Meow in empty rooms tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Claws in your leg i see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy, but ask for petting this human feeds me, i should be a god yet chase mice. Get my claw stuck in the dog's ear eat half my food and ask for more so tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor purr for no reason russian blue. Demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it claw drapes, or to pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly for run as fast as i can into another room for no reason. Attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently. Lick plastic bags. Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle for hate dog, and kitty pounce, trip, faceplant you didn't see that no you didn't definitely didn't lick, lick, lick, and preen away the embarrassment, i vomit in the bed in the middle of the night for rub face on everything, leave fur on owners clothes. Gnaw the corn cob. Mess up all the toilet paper decide to want nothing to do with my owner today but check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in yet love to play with owner's hair tie for stretch, and eat the rubberband walk on a keyboard. Ooooh feather moving feather! chew foot hide from vacuum cleaner but dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain present belly, scratch hand when stroked. Chew foot purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table cat milk copy park pee walk owner escape bored tired cage droppings sick vet vomit or fall asleep upside-down.</p>
